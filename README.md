## Objective 
    The objective of our project is to develop a facial expression recognition model using neural networks and convolutional layers in deep learning. <br>
    The model will detect and classify facial expressions in images, contributing to mental health monitoring and patient care applications. <br>
    By accurately identifying facial expressions, healthcare professionals can better assess and track patients’ emotional well-being and mental state. <br>
    Additionally, it can be utilized for psychology research studies, providing valuable insights into human emotions and behavior. <br>

## Motivation 
    Facial emotion recognition plays a crucial role in mental health care. <br>
    It offers an efficient way to evaluate patients’ emotional states, helping healthcare professionals make informed decisions about treatment plans. <br>
    Understanding and addressing mental health conditions are essential for ensuring the well-being of patients and our model can provide valuable support in achieving that goal. <br>

## Method 
    We are going to use deep neural networks to solve the problem. <br>
    Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a deep learning architecture that is one of the state of art methods in image classification. <br>
    In the domain of deep learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN) represents a category of artificial neural networks primarily utilized for the analysis of visual imagery. <br>
    CNNs employ a specialized mathematical operation known as convolution, replacing the conventional matrix multiplication, within at least one of their layers.<br>

## Dataset 
    From Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/code/jonathanoheix/face-expression-recognition-with-deep-learning <br>
    The data consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. <br>
    Each image corresponds to a facial expression in one of seven categories (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral). <br>
    The dataset contains approximately 36K images. 80% of the images are contained inside the train folder, and the last 20% are inside the validation folder.
